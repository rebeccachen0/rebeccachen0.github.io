Welcome!

I'm currently a [Brinson Prize Fellow](https://brinsonfoundation.org/brinson-prize-fellowship-program/) at Stanford's [Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC)](https://kipac.stanford.edu/). I completed my PhD in May 2025 at [Duke University](https://cosmology.phy.duke.edu/), advised by Prof. Dan Scolnic. Prior to that, I was an undergraduate at the University of Chicago working with Prof. Chihway Chang.

I am broadly interested in improving our understanding of dark energy and the expansion history of the universe, particularly using Type Ia supernovae as precise distance indicators. I work on developing methods for photometric cosmological analyses with data from large sky surveys such as the [Dark Energy Survey (DES)](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/), and incoming from the [Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)](https://www.lsst.org/) and the [Roman Space Telescope](https://www.romansnpit.com/). To do so effectively, I'm interested in bridging overlaps in techniques and expertise developed from other cosmological probes that have already long been reliant on photometric redshifts, such as weak lensing and large scale structure.
